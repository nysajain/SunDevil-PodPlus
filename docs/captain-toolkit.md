# Peer Captain Toolkit

This one-page toolkit guides peer captains through each weekly pod meeting. For quick reference, print or bookmark this file.

## Week 1 — Welcome & Safety

- **Warm intro:** Invite everyone to share their name, year and a personal welcome cue (e.g., favorite snack, hobby). Award the **First Hello** badge.
- **Norm setting:** Lead a brief discussion on pod norms (e.g., respectful listening, start/end on time). Limit to two norms.
- **Choose a ritual:** Spend 10 minutes selecting a recurring mini-ritual for your pod (tea circle, 15‑min study sprint, etc.). Award the **Ritual Maker** badge.

## Week 2 — Invitation

- **Low-pressure invites:** Demonstrate how to invite another student to a casual hangout using the Two-Step Invite technique (Ask–Offer–Open). Encourage everyone to invite one peer outside the pod. Award the **Friendly Inviter** badge.
- **Commuter bonus:** If your pod has commuter members, meet between 11:30 and 1:30 near transit or parking. Award the **Commuter Hero** badge.

## Week 3 — Trust & Repair

- **Oops/Ouch practice:** Teach the 2‑minute reset script: when someone says “Oops,” pause; others respond “Ouch” to acknowledge harm; the group briefly resets. Award the **Repair Ready** badge.
- **Language allyship:** Use a visual agenda, slower pacing and (if needed) a translation app. Invite members to indicate pacing preferences. Award the **Language Ally** badge.

## Week 4 — Coalition Building

- **Club bridge:** As a pod, attend one campus event or club meeting together. Award the **Club Connector** badge.
- **Low‑stimulus social:** For sensory-sensitive members, select a quiet or ADA-friendly space and split the session between quiet socializing and regular activity. Award the **Sensory Friendly** badge.

## Micro‑Skills Cards

- **Invite without pressure:** Use the Ask–Offer–Open pattern: ask permission (“Can I invite you to…”), make a specific offer (“…a 15‑min coffee break after class”), and leave it open (“…no worries if not!”).
- **Oops/Ouch:** When someone accidentally hurts or excludes someone, they can say “Oops” to acknowledge. The impacted person can say “Ouch” to share that it hurt. Take two minutes to reset, clarify intentions and reaffirm norms.
- **Pair–Share:** For shy members, break into pairs for 3–5 minutes to discuss a prompt before sharing back to the group.
- **Language ally prompts:** Slow down your speech, provide written bullet points, and use translation apps as needed. Encourage multilingual members to share phrases in their languages.
- **Sensory options:** Offer choices like natural light vs. low light, quieter vs. active spaces and fidget tools or seating cushions.

## Captain Incentives

- Earn a **digital micro‑credential** (“Peer Captain — Inclusive Community Building”) upon completing one full 4‑week cycle.
- Receive a **letter of recognition** from the Student Success Center.
- Participate in **captain-only raffles** for gift cards and ASU swag.
