# Slide Outline for SunDevil Pods+ Pitch

1. **Opening Problem & Insight** — Introduce loneliness statistics at ASU and the insight that recurring, small groups foster belonging better than one‑off events.
2. **Barriers to Connection** — Summarize identity‑based barriers (commuter, international, first‑gen, sensory, mobility) and structural barriers (skills to invite, repair, coalition). Use visuals from SSC presentation.
3. **Our Solution** — Illustrate SunDevil Pods+ matching (zone + timeslot + interests + tags) and 4‑week Connection Quests micro‑curriculum. Show pods diagram.
4. **Co‑operative Game Mechanics** — Explain the points, badges, and rewards system emphasizing co‑operation over competition.
5. **Prototype Demo** — Sequence: signup → pod match → pod dashboard → quest start → check‑in (confetti & badge) → wallet/store → belonging pulse.
6. **Captain & Admin Tools** — Highlight captain console (scripts, micro‑skills) and the matching script producing pods.json.
7. **Metrics & Impact** — Present pilot plan, success metrics (belonging delta, stickiness, coalition conversion) and potential long‑term outcomes.
8. **Feasibility & Cost** — Briefly outline resource needs (existing spaces, mentors, prizes) and cost estimate for a 100‑student pilot.
9. **Risks & Mitigations** — Discuss anti‑abuse measures (QR check‑in, co‑op thresholds, privacy) and how we protect inclusive participation.
10. **Future & Scalability** — Mention Phase 2 integration with Sun Devil Rewards and potential expansion to other campuses or online cohorts.
